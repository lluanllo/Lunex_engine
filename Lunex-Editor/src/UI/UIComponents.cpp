/**
 * @file UIComponents.cpp
 * @brief Implementation placeholder
 * 
 * All component implementations have been moved to separate files
 * in the Controls/ subdirectory following the Single Responsibility Principle:
 * 
 * - Controls/UIText.cpp      - Text display components
 * - Controls/UIButton.cpp    - Button components  
 * - Controls/UIInput.cpp     - Input field components
 * - Controls/UIProperty.cpp  - Property grid components
 * - Controls/UIImage.cpp     - Image and texture components
 * - Controls/UIState.cpp     - State and utility functions
 * 
 * This file is kept for backward compatibility but all implementations
 * are now in their respective files.
